<p>This week, Amazon released a small plastic button that you can affix to anything. You press the button, and it orders more of a specific product for you.</p>

<p>The device was panned on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9296857">Hacker News</a>. The general public was so skeptical that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/31/amazon-dash-ordering-button/70747342/">journalists had to assure everyone that it was not a silly April Fools joke</a>. It was derided as “<a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/31/amazon-dash-button/">an excess of convenience</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>Few people have complained, as of yet, about the laborious walk to a laptop where they have to sweat and agonize over Amazon’s “one-click” shopping button. But for those weary souls who are tired of having to pull out a smartphone and go through the motions to order more Tide detergent, the cavalry has come.</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">I disagree with the skeptics. The Dash Button is an early iteration of the future of computing.</h2>

<p>When was the last time consumers disliked something because it was “too convenient”? Amazon’s <em>entire goal</em> is to create an “excess of convenience” for shopping.</p>

<p>First, they built a website that was more convenient than going to a store. Then, they improved on the experience with developments like one-click shopping, Prime, and now the Dash Button.</p>

<p>But it won’t stop there. Under the Dash brand, Amazon has also recently rolled out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-replenishment-service">an API for smart devices that can automatically re-order consumables</a> — no button press needed.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">This goes beyond Amazon. Friction is the enemy of all software.</h2>

<p>Good software lowers friction in order to make things more convenient. Uber is an “excess of convenience” for getting a taxi. Twitter is an “excess of convenience” for blogging. Tinder is an “excess of convenience” for online dating.</p>

<p>Every person has a level of friction at which they are willing to do a given task, and as you lower the friction, more people are willing to step over the barrier.</p>

<p>Even small decreases in friction can drive many more people to use a product. I used to work for a large e-commerce company that invested millions of dollars in shaving milliseconds off of web page loading times, because there was a strong correlation between slightly faster load times and increased revenue.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">When computers are frictionless, <a href="http://www.jnd.org/books/the-invisible-computer.html">they become invisible.</a></h2>

<p>Hiding behind Amazon’s little button are <a href="http://cdn.wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Amazon-warehouse.jpg">giant warehouses</a>, logistics networks, payment systems, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UxZDJ1HiPE">robots</a>, and inventory management algorithms. But, because the process of pressing the button is so easy, you never have to stop and think about any of that — it all becomes invisible.</p>

<p>Humans are very good at compartmentalizing ideas. Being able to compartmentalize concepts into levels of abstraction is what lets us think about higher-order concepts.</p>

<p>Programmers call it functional abstraction:</p>

<blockquote>[Functional abstraction] lets us manipulate information without worrying about the details of its underlying representation. Once we figure out how to accomplish a given function, we can put the mechanism in a “black box,” or a “building block” and stop thinking about it. (The Pattern on the Stone, p. 18)</blockquote>

<p>When railroads were invented, they revolutionized transportation. We spent 100 years perfecting the technology of railroads. Explosive growth came from increasing the efficiency and decreasing the friction of railroad systems.</p>

<p>Eventually, we were able to systematize these solutions. <a href="http://a16z.com/2014/10/28/mobile-is-eating-the-world/">We still use railroad technology today, but now we don’t have to think or talk much about it</a>:</p>

<p>And now, the same thing is happening to software:</p>

<img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1600/1*ySdZiRc5GmOoUvP8hvNtLw.jpeg">

<p>Amazon’s Dash Button is a small example of what functional abstraction looks like today. People using these buttons can stop thinking about the fact that computers are even involved in the process of buying things, and devote that time to something else.

<h2 class="section-heading">Skeptics will claim that a few minutes of time saved here-and-there doesn’t change the world.</h2>

<p>It’s hard to comprehend the impact that reducing friction can have when it is multiplied by millions of users. But successful entrepreneurs like Drew Houston are <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3042436/tech-forecast/dropbox-versus-the-world">able to conceptualize how valuable this is</a>:</p>

<blockquote>“Every time we find ways to save you 15 minutes to an hour, times hundreds of millions of people,” he tells me, “it’s, like, we save lifetimes of pain, every day.”</blockquote>

<p>But the time saved by pressing a button instead of logging onto a website is not even the biggest gain. The biggest gain comes from not having to store, recall, and process unnecessary information in your brain.</p>

<p>Imagine that I run out of coffee. I pull out my phone, and add “Buy more coffee” to my to-do list app. Next time I’m at my computer, I need to remember that I had something on my to-do list. Then, I need to remember my Amazon credentials. Next, I need to think about what brand and flavor of coffee I want. Throughout this process, I’ve had to interact with my computer, Amazon’s website, my phone, and my to-do list app. It’s a lot of unnecessary software to deal with, when instead…</p>

<p>I could just push a button and go back to thinking about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The Most Important Thing.</a></p>

<h2 class="section-heading">And that’s the promise of frictionless, invisible computing.</h2>

<p>When you don’t have to worry about the trivial details of life, you can spend all of your time, energy, and mental processes on whatever you consider to be The Most Important Thing.</p>

<p>And when people can focus on The Most Important Thing, and delegate the rest to invisible, frictionless computers, we will have reached the future of computing.</p>
